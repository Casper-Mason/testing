# Casper's Web Sandbox
This is a testing grounds for me learning javascript and stuff.

Currently the plan is to make a simple breeding game.

So far I have successfully made pretty SVG art of gemstones.

Some people like to save I'm distractable.

I'm here to tell you that's not true at all.

Just the other day I was walking to the store saying to myself, "I'm going to get one loaf of bread, and get out."

And then I did.

But when I was walking out, I thought to myself, "You know what? I'm on a low-carb diet. I don't need toast. I can have eggs in the morning instead."

Long story short, that's how I was kicked out of the local chapter of vegan club.

What do you think? If you can't consume things created by the body of an animal in order to be vegan...

...does that mean you're not vegan if you were breastfed by your mom?

Since everyone knows humans are just another species of animal. We belong to the Animal Kingdom after all.

Maybe the issue here is consent.

Since it's hard to determine consent across species.

Hell, sometimes consent is hard to determine between humans.

How will vegans feel when we discover that plants have minds and emotions?

How will vegans feel when we learn to comminicate more effectively with other animals?

I always liked the idea of being in a business partnership with a colony of ants.

They're so smart and industrious.

And so tiny.

I could offer the ants easy acces to food and protection, in return for work.

I'd ask them to dig up precious gemstones.

Gems are useless to ants.

There are places in the world where ant colonies will dig up rubies and deposit them on the surface.

To the ants, its just a big rock in the way of their mining.

But with better communication, they will probably consider gems to have a high trade value.

They might demand more resources for trading.

They might hide all their gems in an underground bunker, and trickle them out slowly to inflate prices.

Basically what the diamond industry is doing now.

But ants are tiny, so we'd probably try to dig up their warehouses.

We might ruin their colonies along the way.

I'm sure the ants would be upset and fight back.

Did you know that ants outweight humans, when all individual weights are totalled?

It might lead to a huge interspecies war.

And I'm not sure we'd be winning.

If you write a scifi novel about this, please send me a free copy.

I will make absolutely sure to show it to all of my friends.

You could call it "The Garnet War".

Just a thought.
